## ‚ú® Introduction

Welcome to **Vodding**, the ultimate streaming experience! Vodding is a blazing fast component for the revolutionary Vodding application. Stream like never before! üéâ

## üéØ Features

- **Real-time Chat**: Engage with your audience through real-time chat.
- **Stream Recording**: Automatically record streams for later viewing.
- **WebSocket Support**: Seamless WebSocket integration for real-time updates.
- **Twitch Integration**: Connect with Twitch to enhance your streaming experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - Containerization platform.

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lodu/vodding.git
   cd vodding
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file**:

   Copy the `example.env` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables.

   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   ```

3. **Run Docker for development**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up --build
   ```

   4. **Start the App and Web services**:

      Since the server and web containers don't do anything by themselves, you'll need to execute the following commands:
      You can attach VSC to the containers and run `bun run dev` inside `/app/<server|web>` or:

      ```bash
      docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml exec server bash -c "cd /app/server && bun run dev"
      docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml exec web bash -c "cd /app/web && bun run dev"
      ```

   ### MongoDB Migrations

   This project uses MongoDB migrations to manage database schema changes. To create a new migration, use the following command:

   ```sh
   bun migrate create <MIGRATION_MESSAGE>
   ```

   This command utilizes the [ts-migrate-mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-migrate-mongoose) package to handle the migration process. Ensure that you replace `<MIGRATION_MESSAGE>` with a descriptive message about the migration.

### Production Setup

git clone https://github.com/lodu/vodding.git
cd vodding

````

2. **Create a `.env` file**:

Copy the `example.env` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables.

```bash
cp example.env .env
````

3. **Run Docker for production**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## üöÄ How It Works

### Architecture

Vodding consists of two main services:

- **App Service**: Handles the backend logic, including Twitch integration, chat logging, and stream recording.
- **Web Service**: Serves the frontend application, providing a luxurious user interface for the ultimate streaming experience.

### Key Components

- **Twitch Integration**: Uses the Twurple library to connect with Twitch and handle events such as stream online/offline.
- **WebSocket Support**: Utilizes Socket.IO for real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **Stream Recording**: Uses Streamlink to record streams automatically when a streamer goes live.
- **Real-time Chat**: Logs chat messages and provides real-time updates to the frontend.
